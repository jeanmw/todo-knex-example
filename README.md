# Notes


What I did well:

* Initial thinking through DB setup / relationships and tradeoffs
* Thinking about business needs and setting up relationships accordingly
* Parsing through Knex docs
* Explaining thought process
* Getting basic working MVP with some super basic security

What I could have done better
* Maybe focusing on a smaller scope and working on more server routing / security code and not focusing the majority of the time on the DB setup
* Was unsure if I was allowed to use Copilot / LLMs - I used chatgpt a couple times in the video, but wasn't sure how closely I should be mimicing my real setup. 
* I could have moved a lot faster if I wasn't talking so much about my planning. System design stuff took a lot of time. Also could have moved faster if I were using LLMs per my normal setup(copilot) but wasn't sure if this was allowed
* Edge case handling, better validations (see some TODOs in code)

Commits are in the repo - unfortunately I was so focused on chatting through my coding that I did not push right away, but the commit atomicity should be reflective of normal practices.
